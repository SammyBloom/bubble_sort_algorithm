# Project
Implementing the Bubble sort algorithm over a random set of numbers using Javascript language.

# What is Sorting in Data Structure
Sorting is a process of ordering or placing a list of elements from a collection in some kind of order. It is nothing but storage of data in sorted order. 
Sorting can be done in ascending and descending order. It arranges the data in a sequence which makes searching easier.

## Sorting Algorithm
A sorting algorithm is a method for reorganizing a large number of items into a specific order, such as alphabetical, highest-to-lowest value or shortest-to-longest distance. 
Sorting algorithms take lists of items as input data, perform specific operations on those lists and deliver ordered arrays as output.

## Types of Sorting Algorithms
Selection sort
Bubble sort
Insertion sort
Merge sort
Quick sort
Heap sort
Counting sort
Radix sort
Bucket sort

## Bubble Sort Algorithm
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. 
This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2) where n is the number of items.
